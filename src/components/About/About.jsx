            Before transition to software engineering, I was a project manager and in my most previous role I had been exposed to software engineering. I quickly found myself desiring to learn more about the field and after researching, I decided I wanted to pursue it as a career. As a result I decided to attend General Assembly's software engineering immersive to help me develop my skills and aid my career switch.
