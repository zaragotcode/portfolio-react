    <h1>About Patrick</h1>
    <p>I’m Patrick, a fullstack software engineering looking to pursue my growing interest in web and mobile development. </p>

    <p>In my previous work experience in project management I was tasked with working on two app development projects which included a scheduling application for sporting events, and booking application for service appointments. Throughout the projects I assisted in the delegation of sprint tasks and responsibilities to team members and managed communication with the client. This experience lead to my exposure in software engineering which I quickly found myself curious to learn more. I found that I loved web development and wanted to pursue it as a career. As a result I decided to attend a coding bootcamp to help me develop my skills and aid my career switch. </p>

    <p>For my hobbies, I am a self-taught music producer. I’ve landed a few records on Apple’s top all genre charts along with Billboards and I hope to officially obtain my first RIAA certified plaque in the next year.</p>
